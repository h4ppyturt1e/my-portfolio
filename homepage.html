            <h2>Who am I?<hr></h2>
            <p>
                Hello there! My name is Ryan Nicholas Permana, otherwise known as <b>h4ppyturt1e</b> in many online communities I interact with!
                <br>
                I'm a 2nd year CSC student from the University of Victoria, and have always been interested in math, computers and programming.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>Where am I from?<hr></h2>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jakarta,+Indonesia/" target="_blank">Jakarta, Indonesia</a>. 
                <i>(If you have never heard of Indonesia, think of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bali/" target="_blank">Bali</a>. There you go.)</i>
                <br>
                I went to high school in Raffles Christian School in Kelapa Gading, in the northern part of Jakarta. If I could only say
                <br>
                three things to describe Jakarta, it would be: <b>Hot, Crowded and Heavy Traffic</b>. That's why when it was entering fall
                <br>
                I found it very difficult to adapt to the <i>Canadian Weatherâ„¢</i>, despite being the warmest city in the country. On the
                <br>
                contrary, the low population density is incredible! I absolutely love it here in Victoria.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>Who are these people in the pictures?<hr></h2>
            <p>
                The pictures I have inserted throughout the website are those of my high school friend group, whom I still keep in contact 
                <br>
                with to this day! Fortunately, two of them went to UBC, and another two went to the University of Washington, which are both 
                <br>
                only a ferry away from Victoria! These people are those that I can be vulnerable with, and I am extremely grateful to have
                <br>
                met them. Hopefully as the decades pass by our friendship will still hold strong! Here's a video of our trip to Lembang, a
                <br>
                a mountainous area a couple hours by car from Jakarta. This was our farewell trip before we all went our separate ways.
                <br>
                By the way, if you click on the rooftop picture, you will find a gallery of images of me and my friends! ===========>

            <h2>Why did I choose Canada to study?<hr></h2>
            <p>
                When I was very young around the age of 8, I visited Canada for the first time to visit my aunt living here. All I can say is that
                <br>
                I absolutely loved it here. The people, the weather, the food, and everything in between! Since then, I decided to work towards
                <br>
                a future in Canada, where I would work my way towards permanent residency and to eventually bring my parents to move in with me here
                <br>
                would be my absolute long-term goal.

                    <h3>Badminton</h3><br><br>
                    <p>
                        I first played badminton in Grade 9 of high school, and since then loved the sport to death. 
                        All I could think of during the pandemic was when would be the next time I could play again. 
                        This wish was soon granted as right after I moved to Victoria, not only did I finally get 
                        to play again, I also found a badminton partner to play with!

                    <h3>Guitar</h3><br><br>
                    <p>
                        In Grade 7, we were forced to buy a guitar for music class. I hated this initially, but couldn't
                        be more grateful today. Soon after this, my mom decided it would be good for me to learn classical
                        guitar, which I did for about 8 years before I switched over to Electric, where I focused more on
                        Jazz and Blues style music. TLDR, I <del>f**cking</del> love the guitar.

                    <h3>Programming</h3><br><br>
                    <p>
                        I was always interested in the idea of how computers worked, math and logic in general. However my first
                        exposure to "programming" would surprisingly be in Minecraft, as there were logic gates that you could
                        create to make extremely complicated machines. Some talented players could even create a working
                        calculator within the game! Since then I started on Python, and the rest is history.

                    <p>
                        Is there really anything better than popping a bag of popcorn in the microwave, choosing a show on your
                        favorite streaming website and sitting on the couch, getting more and more immersed into a world of fantasy
                        and magic? Well for me there probably isn't. <del>(except maybe writing a huge block of code without testing and 
                        having it work without errors)</del> If I could pick a favorite genre it would probably be fantasy anime!
